Dimwater, born under the Lion's Shard\nLagus is the god of farming, peasants and peace. As a specific-mythos priest, you don't have access to turn undead, but instead have the ability to produce enough food for 2 people in wilderness, or 4 in cultivated land (without stealing crops of course). You must wear simple, cheap clothes. This restriction doesn't stop you wearing armour, but it applies to armour to some extent as well (i.e. no heavy armour). The holy symbol is an ear of wheat.","languages":[{"name":"\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tArlanian Common","spokenLevel":"\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tN","writtenLevel":"\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"},{"name":"Orcish\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t","spokenLevel":"1\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t","writtenLevel":"\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"},{"name":"Elven\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t","spokenLevel":"3\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t","writtenLevel":"\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"},{"name":"\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t","spokenLevel":"\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t","writtenLevel":"\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"}],"maximumHP":"2","currentHP":"2","experience":"0","followers":[{"name":"","type":"Donkey","maximumHP":"","currentHP":"","wounds":"","AC":"","attackAdjust":"","attack":"","moveRate":"","equipment":"","notes":""},{"name":"","type":"","maximumHP":"","currentHP":"","wounds":"","AC":"","attackAdjust":"","attack":"","moveRate":"","equipment":"","notes":""}],"weaponProficiencies":[{"name":"Sickle","slots":"1"},{"name":"Spade","slots":"1"},{"name":"Net","slots":"1"},{"name":"Sspare sslotss","slots":"-1"}],"nonweaponProficiencies":[{"name":"Agriculture","slots":"1"},{"name":"Animal handling","slots":"1"},{"name":"Weather sense","slots":"1"},{"name":"Herbalism","slots":"2"},{"name":"Musical instrument (flute)","slots":"1"},{"name":"Navigation","slots":"1"},{"name":"Spellcraft","slots":"1"},{"name":"Sspare sslotss","slots":"-1"}],"memorisedSpells":[{"cast":false,"name":""},{"cast":false,"name":""},{"cast":false,"name":""}],"titleType":"full","carriedEquipment":[{"name":"Spade","weight":"5","initialized":true,"emptyWeight":"0","maxCarry":"0","active":true,"value":"0","skullduggeryArmourType":5,"comments":"sharpened edge for combat"},{"name":"Sickle","weight":"3"},{"name":"Net","weight":"10","number":2},{"name":"gp","weight":"0.05","number":5},{}],"droppedEquipment":[{"name":"Donkey's saddlebags","initialized":true,"container":true,"emptyWeight":"0","maxCarry":"0","value":"0","skullduggeryArmourType":5,"contained":[{"name":"Sickle"},{"name":"Seeds"},{"name":"Flute"},{}]},{}]}}
